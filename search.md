## Search


- What is the end-goal for the User? As a User, I want to ...
- What is the definition of done here?
  - when the user search for something and get results
  - when the user clicks on the desired result
- What are the metrics to measure?
  - no search results rate (to minimize, be specific with what the users are looking for)

## Multi-search

Often, there are more than one things that users can search for. Google provides tabs for users to search for terms, images and videos (and many more for example).

Be specific. When performing multi search, allow users to search just for a particular item. Performing search for all of them will only make other results redundant. E.g. when searching for products, we should not be searching for users too. This will cause the analytics for the user to be redundant, because obviously you will not get the search results for user.
