- sorting is hard if it is across different pages
  - remote sorting: backend does the sorting and return the result to frontend
  - local sorting: sort only the data visible in the page (useful for fixed amount of data)
filtering
  - show the select dropdown ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6033638/156695473-592f6b36-22d0-4d85-935a-619d2e3c04a6.png)
  - when filtering by status etc, show the counts alongside so that users don't need to try all
